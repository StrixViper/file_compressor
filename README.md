File Compressor and Decompressor in C
Overview
This project is a basic file compressor and decompressor implemented in the C programming language. It uses a Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm for compression, which is most effective for files with long sequences of repeated characters. The program allows users to compress files to reduce storage space and decompress them back to their original form.

Features
Compresses text files using the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm.
Decompresses compressed files back to their original form.
Simple command-line interface to interact with the tool.
Input and output file handling.


IT WILL BE EXPAND IN FUTURE. JUST FOR YOU TO USE IT!!
